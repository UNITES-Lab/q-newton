# QMatrix_Inverse

Code for accelerating NGD computation in neural networks with quantum methods

## Goal1: support NGD is good

### 1.1 thoretical paper

### 1.2 empirical evidence

optimization cases
NN cases -> 1-2 MLP (MNIST)

### 1.3 profiling SGD and NGD 



## Goal 2: Current 加速方法不行



### 2.1 K-FAC still have the scalability issues



### 2.1.1 profiling NGD+K_FAC



### 2.1.2 K_FAC approximation is not good enough under which condition



## Goal 3: show the benefits of quantum for matrix inverse



### 3.1 speed



### 3.2 approximation is good



### 3.3 scalability
